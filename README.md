# Bee Gen - Detecting Pollen Grains in Honey Bees and Predicting Crop Growth Rate


Bee Gen is an innovative project that combines machine learning and agriculture to help farmers and honey bee populations. The project uses computer vision algorithms to detect pollen grains in honey bees, which can provide insights into the health of the honey bee population and the quality of the crops they pollinate. Additionally, Bee Gen can predict the growth rate of crops using machine learning algorithms, which can help farmers make informed decisions about their agricultural practices.

## Introduction

Bee Gen was developed as a part of the ADC (Agriculture Development Challenge) in 2022 and was selected as a finalist for its innovative approach to solving a critical problem facing the agriculture industry. The project uses machine learning algorithms to detect pollen grains in honey bees and predict the growth rate of crops. 

## How it Works

The Bee Gen project uses computer vision algorithms to detect pollen grains in honey bees. This is done by analyzing images of honey bees and using machine learning algorithms to identify and count pollen grains. The project can also predict the growth rate of crops using machine learning algorithms. This is done by analyzing environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture levels, as well as historical crop data. 

## Features

- Detects pollen grains in honey bees using computer vision algorithms
- Predicts the growth rate of crops using machine learning algorithms
- Provides insights into the health of the honey bee population and the quality of the crops they pollinate
- Helps farmers make informed decisions about their agricultural practices

## Technologies Used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV, Pillow

## Installation

To run Bee Gen on your local machine, you must have Python 3 installed. Clone the repository to your local machine and install the required libraries using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use Bee Gen, run the following command:

Open the `bee_gen.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to detect pollen grains in honey bees and predict the growth rate of crops.

This will start the program and you can use it to detect pollen grains in honey bees and predict the growth rate of crops.
